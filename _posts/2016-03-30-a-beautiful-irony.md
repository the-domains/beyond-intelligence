Beyond Intelligence is all about human beings and how we can develop ourselves in the face of a massive increase in artificial intelligence. 

Until now, our intelligence has been considered, for the most part, to be our greatest asset. We cultivate it in one to two decades of education for every child and have built our entire culture around it across much of the world.

And it's about to be superceded by code, by something "artificial". A series of 1s and 0s, put together by very clever people, to the extent that it will be able to teach itself, develop itself and solve problems we're unable to tackle with our human brain power - for all our education.

So where does that leave us?

I believe we have a few options, but trying to compete is not one of them. The sooner we give up on that idea the quicker we can do the real work to take us into a future we want to live in. 

**The Essentials**

* We need to explore and discover what it truly means to be human.
* We need to open our hearts and connect with others to unlock our humanity.
* We need to expand our spiritual experience so we can transcend the ordinariness of life.
* We need to explore the human potential that can be released through knowledge of energy.
* We need to develop special abilities and superpowers so we can continue to  stretch ourselves and our ability to contribute to others.
* We need to do all this with integrity and align ourselves with Truth.

It's a beautiful coincidence that on the day I decided to write this blog I was invited to join The Grid. Artificial Intelligence meets Human Being. 

I'm curious to see what will come of this collaboration.
